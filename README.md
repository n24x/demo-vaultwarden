## Example Implementation: Vaultwarden Password Manager

This is an example implementation based on the instructions provided in the [Vaultwarden Wiki](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki). Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Clone the repository this repo

2. Copy the `env.template` file to `.env` and edit the `.env` file to add your configuration.

3. To generate an admin password that needs to be added to the `.env` file, use the following command:
```
echo -n "MySecretPassword" | argon2 "$(openssl rand -base64 32)" -e -id -k 19456 -t 2 -p 1
```
4. After editing the `.env` file and ensuring that your settings are correct, run the following command:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

Please note that you may need to install the necessary dependencies and ensure that Docker is properly set up on your system before running the above commands.
